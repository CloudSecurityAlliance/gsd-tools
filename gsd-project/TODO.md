# GSD Projects

The gsd-project repo is designed to support the project, meeting times, agendas, minutes, planning, roadmaps, vision, etc. are contained here.
### Todo
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Policy - Policy mostly doesn't exist today. We need to write down a lot of what's happening in the project as well as future goals. This TODO list should probably exist there too. You can find the closest thing to a policy repo here https://github.com/cloudsecurityalliance/gsd-project-plans It's very disorganized and needs organization.
- [ ] GSD needs a logo
