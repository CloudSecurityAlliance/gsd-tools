# CVE 2021 no affected version in data raw list

Many 2021 CVE's contain no meta data about the affected product/version. A raw list is:

CVE-2021-no-affected-version-raw-list.txt

Many do not have vulnerability text in the CVE description either, meaning you must go to the original source material to determine what is/is not affected.

# Reccomendations:

1. Ensure meta data is present or explain why it is not present (e.g. Cloud services may legitimately have no version data)
