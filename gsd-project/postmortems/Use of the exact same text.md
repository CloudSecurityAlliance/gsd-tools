# Use of the exact same text

Please note this is just 2021 data, I haven't bothered to look at older data.

Many CVEs are now using the exact same text, here is a sample of those using the same text 10 times or more in 2021. For 2021 there are 371 CVE text descriptions used more than once for 1429 CVE entries (as of 2021-11-15).

```
wget https://nvd.nist.gov/feeds/json/cve/1.1/nvdcve-1.1-2021.json.gz
gzip -d nvdcve-1.1-2021.json.gz
grep -A 2 "\"description_data\"" nvdcve-1.1-2021.json  | grep "\"value\""  | sort  | uniq -d | wc -l
grep -A 2 "\"description_data\"" nvdcve-1.1-2021.json  | grep "\"value\""  | sort  | uniq -cd  | cut -d"\"" -f1 | sed 's/ //g' | awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}'
```

|11|"Zoho ManageEngine ADManager Plus version 7110 and prior allows unrestricted file upload which leads to remote code execution."|
|13|"Vulnerability in the MySQL Server product of Oracle MySQL (component: Server: Optimizer). Supported versions that are affected are 8.0.25 and prior. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 4.9 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)."|
|13|"Vulnerability in the Oracle iStore product of Oracle E-Business Suite (component: Shopping Cart). Supported versions that are affected are 12.1.1-12.1.3 and 12.2.3-12.2.10. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle iStore. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle iStore, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle iStore accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle iStore accessible data. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 8.2 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N)."|
|15|"Vulnerability in the MySQL Server product of Oracle MySQL (component: Server: Optimizer). Supported versions that are affected are 8.0.26 and prior. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 4.9 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)."|
|20|"Vulnerability in the Oracle Outside In Technology product of Oracle Fusion Middleware (component: Outside In Filters). The supported version that is affected is 8.5.5. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Outside In Technology. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Oracle Outside In Technology. Note: Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS Base Score depend on the software that uses Outside In Technology. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 7.5 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)."|
|30|"Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly. These vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on the affected device."|

# Recommendations:

1. CVE text descriptions are no longer important, under CNA 3.0 rules they don't even need to have a Vendor/Product/Version. Ironically you must use CVE ID's to differentiate CVE ID's from each other using the description text since there is no relational data included in the CVE data.
2. The CNA rule changes from 2 to 3 now mean that for many CVE ID's you must go to the JSON data or the original source material in order to determine what is going on (affected versions, vulnerability, etc.)
