# Notes on CVE Data Sources

## NVD API

The NVD API (https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities) appears to serve identical JSON as is in the JSON downloads.

# In summary:

* The MITRE Download page files (CSV/HTML/TXT/XML|JSON) contain far less data than the MITRE GitHub repo and the NVD JSON files. Don't use them.
* MITRE only publishes the "publishedDate" which is whhen the CVE was assigned OR RESERVED, so it can be months in advance of the CVE actually being used
* MITRE's machine readable affected data is usually incomplete, and missing in roughly 25% of entries, NVD has analysts add affected data in CPE format
* The NVD publishedDate and the MITRE Assigned data are often different, it appears sometimes NVD uses the date of the first source becoming public (sometimes years or a decade in advance)

The best source of CVE data that contains information (e.g. STATE is PUBLIC) is the NVD files/API. If you want to track RESERVED and so on you will want to get the MITRE GitHub JSON data.
