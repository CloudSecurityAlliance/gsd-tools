# GSD Tools

This repository (repo) is a part of the [Global Security Database (GSD)](https://globalsecuritydatabase.org), an open source project by the [Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org) to address gaps within the current vulnerability identifier space.

If you are unfamiliar with the GSD and the vulnerability identifier space, please read the following document: **TODO: Create a tl;dr of what GSD & vuln ids are within gsd-project**

If you're looking to contribute or file a bug, please see the following guide: **TODO: Extract the repo descriptions & issue guide to a doc within gsd-project**

The `gsd-tools` repo contains any tools, parsers, applications, and other code related to the GSD. The data for the identifiers themselves live within the [gsd-database](https://github.com/cloudsecurityalliance/gsd-database) repo, and any non-data, non-code related documentation (such as meeting times and policies) live within the [gsd-project](https://github.com/cloudsecurityalliance/gsd-project) repo.
